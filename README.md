This is a script which automatically plays hangman.

For proper execution, please respect the following format:
    python "location_to_program/program.py" -i "path_to_guess_words" -o "path_to_output_file" -d "dictionary_of_language"

Note: If the word you are trying to search is not in the dictionary then it will fallback on to a liniar search in a list of letters that are used in ROMANIAN. Therefore, there might not be a possible way of guessing a word given the inital list of letters.
